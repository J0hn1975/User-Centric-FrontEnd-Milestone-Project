                                    The frontman for British hitmakers the Small Faces and Humble Pie, singer/guitarist Steve Marriott was born January 30, 1947 in London; a successful child actor, he played the role of the Artful Dodger in the musical Oliver! as a teen, but by the mid-'60s, he was working in a local music shop. There he met bassist Ronnie Lane, agreeing to jam with his band the Pioneers; Marriott soon joined the group full-time and, after adopting a sound influenced by American R&B and a look inspired by Mod fashions, they rechristened themselves the Small Faces.

Born September 16, 1948 and raised in the East End of London, England, Jones took up the drums at the age of 13. Learning quickly from playing along to recordings by Booker T. & the MG's, Jones became a session drummer by the age of 15. By the mid-'60s, he was a member of a group called "the Pioneers", which eventually transformed in to the Small Faces.
